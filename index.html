<!-- About -->

    <h2>About <i>Emily</i></h2>   
      <p>I have been a problem-solver with a knack for investigation my entire life. When I fell into coding, I felt like I had finally found my place in the world. I also am consumed by wanderlust, and I can be sparked with inspiration by the new places I visit and people I meet! I am a huge fan of how coding is a pliable and usable art. If we can think it, we can make it real! I strive to work on a team of great programmers. I feel it is one of the most rewarding elements of this industry. When we combine brainpower, experience, and creativity, the possibilities are endless! My hobbies outside of coding include: DJing on my Pioneer XDJ-RX2 mixer, reading, and longboarding.</p>
      <p>I can (want to) provide clients with these services:</p>
         <ol>
          <li>Custom software engineering</li>
          <li>Website and mobile app creation</li>
          <li>Turning ideas and dreams into a final product</li>
        </ol>
