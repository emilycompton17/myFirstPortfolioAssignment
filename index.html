<!--- About --->

    <h2>About <i>emily</i></h2>   
      <p>I have been a problem-solver with a knack for investigation my entire life. When I fell into coding, I felt like I had finally found my place in the world. I also am consumed by wanderlust, and working in software engineering I am able to become sparked with inspiration by the new places I visit and people I meet! I am a huge fan of how coding is a pliable and usable art. If we can think it, we can make it real!</p>
      <p>Brainstorming and building new projects with a team is one of the most rewarding things about coding, I feel. It brings great people together to create and produce amazing things!</p>
      <p>Hobbies other than coding include: DJing on my Pioneer XDJ-RX2 mixer, reading, and longboarding.</p>
      <p>I can (want to) provide you with these services:</p>
         <ol>
          <li>Custom software engineering</li>
          <li>Website creation and mobile apps</li>
          <li>Making ideas and dreams into a final product</li>
        </ol>
